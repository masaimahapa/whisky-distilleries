# Cluster Whisky Distillers
In this project I cluster whisy distillers according to their taste profiles.
To achieve this, I use a method of unsupervised learning called Clustering. The algorithm of choice is K-Means clustering as it is fast and efficient.

In total, I come up with 3 clusters which differ in taste and I hope this will help in choosing the next (or first) purchase of a bottle of smooth Scotch whisky.
